# BTMux--- This is a repository for finding the main files needed to get a BTmux, or Battletech Mux, up and running.  There's a real possibility that
you may not even know what that is, considering the way things are going these days.  The best way to think of it is that it's a real time multiplayer
battletech game that's run over the internet.  That's the best I got time to give you.
